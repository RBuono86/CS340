# CS340 Client/Server Development 

# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

When I create software that is maintained easily for reading and adaptability, I make sure it can be easily transfered and modular. By doing this I sue the CRUD module using in Project Three is easily interchanged with Project One and Project Two respectively updating and deleting data from the database. 

# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

To approach the software computer scientists use primary critical thinking. I analyze the challenging ways of how clients want things done for applications. The understanding of the requirements of the applications gives me so many possibilities  to interpret solutions and decide what works best to solve those challenges I run into. So when I develop the test cases with pass and fail metrics for each of those requirements, I will see every aspect of which one will be more closer to the solution that will work best.Then finally I use the right one that will use the method to develop the quality application and software for the client.

# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists find challenges and interprets the challengs and tests every solutions as they get them. These processes are important to create quality usable software to deliver to that cient. If do this without trying to create a solution to a challenge, there is no way to learn and grow from the experience. Software takes time to perfect and even then it grows as technology grows. Software also has that tendency to be developed modularly created for companies later as they ask for them further in the future becuase no company asks for software every year.This makes modules that much easier to be replaced or implemented or implemented elsewhere saving time and space for companies like Graziosos Salvare.
